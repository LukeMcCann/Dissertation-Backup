ACO vs Genetic Algorithm

While ACO can be considered a kind of genetic algorithm (we evolve a solution over generational iterations)
it differs in one main aspect. In genetic algorithms we explicitly create a cross-over between the most
successful chromosomes to create the next generation. In ACO we are utilising the concept of Stigmergy 
which means each colony we generate in our main loop is different, however they communicate over space 
as well as time using the pheromone matrices.
